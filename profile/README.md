# MJ API Development

Welcome to MJ API Development! We are a team of developers focused on building cutting-edge APIs that provide valuable insights for traders and investors.

## Our Work

Our flagship product is the **Intelligent EOD Stock Market API**, a powerful API that provides end-of-day stock market data for traders and investors. With our API, you can easily access historical and real-time stock data, including:

- Daily stock prices
- Company financials
- Company news
- Stock fundamentals
- Technical indicators

Our API is built using modern web technologies and provides a simple and intuitive interface for developers to access the data they need. We are committed to providing high-quality, reliable data to our customers, and we strive to make our API as accessible as possible.
